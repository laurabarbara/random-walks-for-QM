# Random Walks for Quantum Mechanics

First of two projects for the PHYS6017 Computer Techniques in Physics module of my MPhys programme. The project consists of simulating three 'particle in a box' scenarios using random walks with the appropriate parameters and caclulating the energy values of the four lowest energy states. The simulations, data analysis and plotting were done in Python 3, and the report was produced using Overleaf.
